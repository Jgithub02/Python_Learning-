In this repository, I stored all the code of Python while learning Python 

# What Is Python 
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
```
It is used for:
web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.
```
For Example 
```
Print("Hello World")
'Hello World'
```
Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
For Example 
```
print("Hello World") #This is a comment
```
# Variables 
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
For Example 
```
x = 5
y "Hello"
print(x)
5
print(y)
'Hello'
```
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
```
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
```
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```
Variable names are case-sensitive.
```
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
```
# Python Data Types
